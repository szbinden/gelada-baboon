> * Project Title: Modelling social affiliation in gelada baboons

## General Introduction

Gelada baboons live in one of the most complex social structures among the whole animal kingdom. They form a so called multi level society where the females live in a harem with only one male in it. The rest of the male monkeys form pure male groups. Especially interesting are the unparalleled strong female bonds within the harem. By simulating this complex social system we want to show what are the benefits of such a social system compared to other social structures and to increase our understanding of affiliative behaviour among geladas. We try to attempt this simulation of by applying some changes to a model published by Gonzalez et al. in 2009 that can be used to simulate social affiliations in primates.

%(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
%(Add real-world examples, if any)
%(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

Under what circumstances can a population benefit of a multi level society social structure? 

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
